 What it does:

 Smart Food Pantry is a web-based system that helps hotels and cafés reduce food waste through smart inventory management. Users can add food items with quantity and expiry dates, receive alerts before items expire, and identify surplus food.
The platform also connects businesses with nearby NGOs and orphanages for food donation. For non-donatable items, it provides composting guidance to ensure eco-friendly disposal.


 Status:
Completed basic version. Improvements planned.
